**Input Size:** This refers to the size of the data the algorithm operates on. 
We use the letter "n" to represent the input size, 
which could be the number of elements in an array or the number of nodes in a linked list.

**Units of Measurement:** We use different measurements to quantify time and operations. For time, 
we can measure the execution time in milliseconds. 
For operations, we count the number of steps or basic operations performed by the algorithm.

**Orders of Growth:** Orders of growth describe how the algorithm's performance changes as the input size increases. 
Common notations like O(1), O(n), O(n^2), etc., are used to represent different growth rates. For example,
O(1) means the algorithm's performance remains constant regardless of the input size.

**Best Case, Worst Case, Average Case:** These are different scenarios we consider to evaluate the algorithm's efficiency. 
The best case represents the most favorable input, where the algorithm performs optimally. 
The worst case represents the input that leads to the highest time or space complexity. The average case considers 
the expected input and calculates the average efficiency over all possible inputs.

Regarding linked lists, there are two types: **singly linked lists** and **doubly linked lists**. 
In a singly linked list, each node has a reference to the next node in the sequence. In a doubly linked list, 
each node has references to both the next node and the previous node, allowing traversal in both directions.
