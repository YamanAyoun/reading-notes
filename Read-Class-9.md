# LINQ
Language-Integrated Query (LINQ) is a set of technologies in C# that allows for the integration of query capabilities directly into the language. LINQ provides a declarative query syntax, known as query expressions, which enables filtering, ordering, grouping, and transforming data from various sources such as SQL databases, XML documents, and .NET collections.

Query expressions in LINQ are written using a syntax that resembles a specialized query language. These expressions are converted to Standard Query Operator method calls during compilation, following the rules specified in the C# specification. It is also possible to express the same queries using method syntax.

## LINQ queries involve three main actions:

1. **Obtaining the data source:** The data source, such as an array or any type implementing the generic IEnumerable interface, is used to retrieve data.

2. **Creating the query:** The query expression specifies the desired information to retrieve from the data source. It can also include sorting, grouping, and shaping instructions. The query is stored in a query variable and initialized with the query expression, which consists of clauses like from, where, and select.

3. **Executing the query:** The query variable stores the query commands, but the actual execution is deferred until the query is iterated over in a foreach statement. This deferred execution concept allows for more efficient processing.

The basic query operations in LINQ include:

`Filter:` The where clause filters the elements based on a specified condition, returning only those that satisfy it.

`orderby:` The orderby clause sorts the elements in the resulting sequence according to the default comparer for the type being sorted.

`Group:` The group clause allows grouping the results based on a specified key.

`Join:` Join operations establish associations between sequences that don't have an explicit relationship in the data sources.

`Select:` The select clause determines the shape or type of each returned element, producing the final results of the query.

By utilizing LINQ, developers can write concise and expressive queries that seamlessly integrate with the C# language, enabling efficient and flexible data manipulation.
