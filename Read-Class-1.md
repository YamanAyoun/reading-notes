# Readings: Exception Handling

Tracing the call stack helps identify the sequence of function calls during an error, 
aiding in issue diagnosis. Catching unexpected financial expenses in try/catch blocks can facilitate contingency planning. 
However, using `try/catch` excessively can impact performance. The **.NET** approach to exception handling recovers from errors, likened to a safety net. 
Mistakes in Therac-25 involved software bugs, inadequate safety measures, and poor error handling, leading to radiation overdoses. 
Ariane 5's failure resulted from reusing incompatible code, causing an overflow. These cases emphasize the need for thorough development practices,
testing, error handling, and system consideration for reliability and safety.
