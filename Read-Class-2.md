## What Unit Testing:

Unit testing focuses on isolating and testing specific units of code, typically methods, 
in isolation without external dependencies. It does not involve interacting with databases or external systems, 
performing large-scale operations, or testing multiple components or systems together. 
Unit testing aims to verify specific aspects of a method's behavior in isolation. While tools and practices like TDD, 
mocks, test runners, and frameworks are commonly associated with unit testing, they are not strictly required for a test to be considered a unit test.
The main goal of unit testing is to test individual units of code in isolation, ensuring their correct behavior without relying on external factors.

## Using a Unit Test Framework:

Deleting the existing console project, the author suggests using a unit test framework instead.
By right-clicking on the solution and adding a project, you can choose the "Unit Test Project Template" under the "Test" category.
This template sets up a new project specifically designed for unit testing and provides the necessary infrastructure to write and run tests efficiently.
With a unit test project in place, you can write individual test methods using the framework's syntax and structure.
The unit test framework provides features like test discovery, assertion libraries, and test runners that simplify the process of writing, organizing, and executing unit tests.
By leveraging a unit test framework, you can automate the execution of tests and easily track their output, making the testing process more efficient and manageable.
