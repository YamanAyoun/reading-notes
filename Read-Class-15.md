# Trees

## What is Tree
A tree is a nonlinear hierarchical data structure that consists of nodes connected by edges.

## Why Tree Data Structure?
Other data structures such as arrays, linked list, stack, and queue are linear data structures that store data sequentially. 
In order to perform any operation in a linear data structure, the time complexity increases with the increase in the data size.

## Tree components
* Node - A Tree node is a component which may contain its own values, and references to other nodes.
* Root - The root is the node at the beginning of the tree.
* K - A number that specifies the maximum number of children any node may have in a k-ary tree. In a binary tree, k = 2.
* Left - A reference to one child node, in a binary tree.
* Right - A reference to the other child node, in a binary tree.
* Edge - The edge in a tree is the link between a parent and child node.
* Leaf - A leaf is a node that does not have any children
* Height - The height of a tree is the number of edges from the root to the furthest leaf.

## Traversals
An important aspect of trees is how to traverse them. Traversing a tree allows us to search for a node, print out the contents of a tree, and much more!
### 1. Depth First
Depth first traversal is where we prioritize going through the depth (height) of the tree first.

Here are three methods for depth first traversal:
1. Pre-order: ``root >> left >> right``
2. In-order: ``left >> root >> right``
3. Post-order: ``left >> right >> root``

### 2. Breadth First
Breadth first traversal iterates through the tree by going through each level of the tree node-by-node. Traditionally, breadth first traversal uses a queue to traverse the width/breadth of the tree.

### Searching a BST
Searching a BST can be done quickly, because all you do is compare the node you are searching for against the root of the tree or sub-tree. If the value is smaller, you only traverse the left side. If the value is larger, you only traverse the right side.

### Big O
- The Big O time complexity of a Binary Search Treeâ€™s insertion and search operations is O(h), or O(height).
- The Big O space complexity of a BST search would be O(1). During a search, we are not allocating any additional space.
