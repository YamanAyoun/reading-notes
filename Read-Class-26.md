## Intro to MVC

MVC, which stands for Model-View-Controller, is a design pattern or architectural approach used in web application development. It offers a more efficient alternative to traditional ASP.NET Web Applications. The core concept of MVC involves dividing the application's design into three distinct layers: Model, View, and Controller, each serving specific purposes.

The Controller is a crucial component that manages user requests. Often referred to as the heart of the MVC application, the Controller handles incoming requests and generates responses by interacting with the Model and loading appropriate Views with data.

MVC's versatility shines through its ability to reuse logic across different types of applications. For instance, you can use the same underlying logic for both ASP.NET MVC Applications and mobile apps by simply changing the View Layer. This enhances code reusability.
