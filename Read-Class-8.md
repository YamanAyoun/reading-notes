## What is a collection C# 

It is a class, so you must declare an instance of the class before you can add elements to that collection. 
If your collection contains elements of only one data type, you can use one of the classes in the System.


Arrays are suitable when you have a fixed number of strongly typed objects. 
They have a predetermined size and can only store elements of the same data type. 
Arrays provide efficient random access to elements by index.

Collections, offer more flexibility for working with groups of objects. Unlike arrays, 
collections can grow and shrink dynamically as needed. 
They can store elements of different data types or objects that share a common base class or implement a common interface. 
Some collections also support assigning keys to objects for quick retrieval.


## What is enum C#

An enum type, is a value type that allows you to define a set of named constants associated with integral numeric values. 
To define an enum type, you use the enum keyword and specify the names of the constants within curly braces.

By default, the constants in an enum type are of type int and start with a value of zero. 
The subsequent constants increase by one in the order they are defined. and you have the flexibility to explicitly specify any other integral numeric type as the underlying type for the enum, and you can also assign specific values to the constants.
