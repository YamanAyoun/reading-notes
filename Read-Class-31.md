# Razor Pages

Razor Pages, a modern web application programming model, simplifies web development by adopting a file-based routing approach,
reducing the complexity often associated with ASP.NET MVC. In Razor Pages, each file under the Pages directory represents an endpoint.

## Why choose Razor Pages?


Razor Pages is primarily used for cross-platform server-side HTML generation. It leverages the widely used C# programming language for server-side development and employs 
the user-friendly Razor templating syntax to seamlessly embed C# code within HTML markup. This combination allows developers to dynamically generate content for web browsers,
making it a recommended framework for server-side web development.

- Beginner-Friendly: It provides a more accessible entry point for newcomers to web development due to its simplicity compared to MVC.

- Scalability: It excels in smaller-scale scenarios where the complexity of creating separate controllers and models is unnecessary.

- Efficient Routing: Razor Pages simplifies routing by automatically matching requests to corresponding Razor Pages in the Pages folder, making navigation straightforward.

- Integrated Logic: Each Razor Page can be associated with a Page Model, allowing application logic to be neatly organized within these models, simplifying handling of various HTTP verbs like GET and POST.
